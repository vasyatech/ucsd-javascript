Question 1

I've got this groovy object of menu items.
Please output them in a discernable fashion so my customers can order

Style is your choice...you're the web guru

Now that you've outputted the menu in JavaScript, let the user order and save their order as a JSON string in localStorage

Add a button with the label "Your Order". Onclick, show the user what they have ordered
